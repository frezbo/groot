### Description

This started when my friend challenged me to create the smallest container image that prints something to stdout. This an ELF stripped binary, reffered from: http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/hello.asm.txt. I appreciate if anyone can create a small docker image than this.
